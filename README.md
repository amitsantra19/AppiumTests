# AppiumTests
I am creating a End to End Framework for Mobile Application Testing using Appium 
I have used TestNG for framework designed to simplify a broad range of testing needs.
I have Maven : Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM),
Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
